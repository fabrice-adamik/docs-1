Before exploring the detailed specifications and API references, review these high-level principles for an overview of the Staking API's capabilities and workflow.

## API Categories

The Meria Staking API is organized into four main categories:

- **Chain**: Query blockchain network information and validators
- **Account**: Retrieve account states, balances, and history
- **Transaction**: Manage transaction lifecycle from encoding to broadcasting
- **Utils**: Handle utility operations and helper functions
