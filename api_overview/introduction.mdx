## Introduction
The Meria Staking API follows RPC principles, providing streamlined and predictable interactions for staking integrations across multiple blockchain networks. It features resource-oriented URLs, processes JSON-encoded data, and utilizes standard HTTP methods and response codes to ensure smooth and efficient staking operations.

## Chain-Agnostic Staking
The Meria Staking API is designed with a chain-agnostic approach, ensuring that developers do not need to manage blockchain-specific staking logic within their codebase. This means:

- No need to adapt your code for different staking protocols.

- No reliance on blockchain-specific APIs‚Äîone unified interface for all Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chains.

- Simplified delegation, rewards management, and unstaking across multiple networks.

By abstracting away chain-specific complexities, our API enables seamless staking integration across 40+ PoS blockchains without requiring custom logic for each chain.

## Focused Functionality
Each API request processes single objects to ensure precise updates, supporting clear and straightforward blockchain interactions. This precision aligns with our goal of maintaining simplicity and clarity in blockchain integrations.


## Authentication

Access to the Meria API requires an API key to authenticate requests. Include your API key in the Authorization header of each request using the following format:

```
Authorization: <your API Key>
```

Here is a test key you can use for testing.
You can also request your own personal key by contacting us.

## Error Handling
The API follows standard HTTP response codes to indicate request outcomes:

‚úÖ 2xx ‚Äî Success (staking transaction submitted, rewards claimed, balance retrieved).

‚ö†Ô∏è 4xx ‚Äî Client-side errors (e.g., missing parameters, insufficient stake balance, invalid validator address).

üö® 5xx ‚Äî Server-side errors (rare, but indicate an issue with Meria's staking infrastructure).

All error responses include clear messages and error codes to aid debugging.

## OpenAPI Specification

## Versioning
The Meria Staking API is continuously evolving, ensuring that updates are:

‚úÖ Backward-compatible across all supported staking networks.

‚úÖ Optimized for security and efficiency in staking transactions.

‚úÖ Scalable to support new PoS blockchains as they emerge.

Our chain-agnostic approach ensures future-proof integrations, allowing developers to stake across multiple ecosystems without major codebase modifications.
