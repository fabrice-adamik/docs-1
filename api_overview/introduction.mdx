## Introduction

Our API follows RPC principles, providing streamlined and predictable interactions for staking integrations across multiple blockchain networks. It features resource-oriented URLs, processes JSON-encoded data, and utilizes standard HTTP methods and response codes.

## Chain-Agnostic Staking

Our API is designed with a chain-agnostic approach, ensuring that developers do not need to manage blockchain-specific staking logic within their codebase:

- Write once, deploy everywhere - no need to adapt your code for different staking protocols
- Single unified interface for all Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chains
- Simplified delegation, rewards management, and unstaking across multiple networks

By abstracting away chain-specific complexities, our API enables seamless staking integration across 40+ PoS blockchains.

## Authentication

Access to the API requires an API key to authenticate requests. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: <your-api-key>
```

## Error Handling

The API follows standard HTTP response codes:

- ‚úÖ 2xx ‚Äî Success (staking transaction submitted, rewards claimed, balance retrieved)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 4xx ‚Äî Client-side errors (missing parameters, insufficient balance, invalid address)
- üö® 5xx ‚Äî Server-side errors (rare, but indicate an infrastructure issue)

All error responses include clear messages and error codes to aid debugging.



## Versioning

Our API is continuously evolving while maintaining:

- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ Security optimizations
- ‚úÖ Support for new PoS blockchains

The chain-agnostic approach ensures future-proof integrations, allowing you to stake across multiple ecosystems without major codebase modifications.
